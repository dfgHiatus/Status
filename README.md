# Status

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that lets you set an in-game status.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [Status.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/Status/releases/latest/download/Status.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

To view your status, search for `https://api.neos.com/api/users/U-(Your Name)`. The status will appear under `profile/description`

Note this mod doesn't give you the ability to view your own or other user's status - this may be the product of another mod, or a LogiX creation
