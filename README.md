# Status

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that lets you set an in-game cloud-readable status.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [Status.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/Status/releases/latest/download/Status.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Install [NeosModSettings.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings/releases/latest/download/NeosModSettings.dll)
1. Start the game. Search for "Status" inside of NeosModSettings, any edits you make to the string variable will set your cloud status.

To view your status, search for `https://api.neos.com/api/users/U-(Your Name)`. The status will appear under `profile/description`

*Note this mod doesn't give you the ability to view other user's statuses - this may be the product of another mod, or a LogiX creation*
