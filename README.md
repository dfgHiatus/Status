## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [Status.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/Status/releases/latest/download/Status.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Install [ResoniteModSettings.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ResoniteModSettings/releases/latest/download/ResoniteModSettings.dll)
1. Start the game. Search for "Status" inside of ResoniteModSettings, any edits you make to the string variable will set your cloud status.

To view your status, search for `https://api.resonite.com/users/U-(Your Name)`. The status will appear under `profile/description`

*Note this mod doesn't give you the ability to view other users' statuses - this may be the product of another mod, or a Protoflux creation*
